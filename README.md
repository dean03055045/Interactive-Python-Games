# Interactive-Python-Games
This repository contains programs which are projects assigned by classes “An introduction to Interactive Programming in Python” and “Principles of Computing” on Coursera. These programs are developed under the browser-based development environment [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) in Python 2. In order to fully experience the performance of these games, please visit the URL in docstring at the top of each game code with Google Chrome, press the run button at the upper left corner and have fun.
